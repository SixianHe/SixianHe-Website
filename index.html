        <p class="lead mb-4">Psychologist Karen Horney once had a theory: if parents suppress the childâ€™s hostility, the childâ€™s hostility may be transformed into anxiety and even extend to the childâ€™s entire worldview. There are too many families "in the name of love", which confuses the borders between children and parents, so that the anger of being violated has nowhere to vent. And once anger is not vented for a long time, it may transform from explicit anger to generalized anxiety, and we will feel that we are useless. Expressing anger by using curse words can relieve some anxiety. Though it might not be a relatively good method to make parents notice, expressing anger can make others understand what our needs are and where our boundaries are. Psychologist Dan Moshavi said that people who dare to get angry can make others feel that they are authentic and trustworthy, and therefore they are more popular. Getting angry is also good, even if the object is our family or friends. We are not angry because of anger, but because our needs are ignored. And using curse words make our words sound stronger and more persuasive like Wen said.
When I first came to the United States for school, I was a foreigner and my English was not good. I hadThere is no right to speak on the group projects. Seeing the moments when they continued to ignore my proposals, I suddenly became angry and methodically said my thoughts out loud. There were no grammatical errors, the structure was clear, and the content was clear. Everyone was scared. A girl who looked quietly turned out There is this side. I didn't feel guilty about my anger this time, I quickly recovered my calm and continued to work as usual. Instead, the attitude of those who have been ignoring me changed. Anger is like an alarm, telling you what needs have been ignored, and where you need to protect yourself. At the same time reminding others that I am not easy to be messed with.
There are also benefits of being cursed in my site of view. One of my friends cried to me that she has been scolded by her leader since started working in a new company. I tried to enlighten her because I thought being cursed can also make people progress more. As time goes on, she will realize her mistakes and correct them, and the number of being scolded will decrease. ust imagine if the leader never criticizes you or ignores you, then you are definitely far away from being promoted, and you won't arrange important things for you. In addition, the general swearing leaders are relatively easy to socialize. They tend to be more straightforward and direct. It is even more terrifying that people give you a smile everyday but want to harm you. We can also learn from the leadersâ€™ scolding. People go to higher places. As long as you work hard, you will have the day to become a leader. Then we can warn ourselves not to be this kind of person, and not to use violence to hurt others.
